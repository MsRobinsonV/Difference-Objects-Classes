The differences between "Classes" and "Objects" in Advanced Java?

A Class is a blue print of the object. Just like buying a house and owning the house, the investors might want to really own their home by investing in the blueprint (the layout) of their new home or investment. 
In Advance Java a "Class" gives a fundamental abstract of an object-oriented design which defines: state or data (Fields),influence behavior (Methods), initializes objects (constructors), memory management and application architecture.

Properties (Structure): Defines data all houses must have such as number of bedrooms, square footage and street address and number of bathrooms.
Behaviors (Methods): Defines features and actions a house can be associated with such as smart home, automatic air central and heating.

In Advanced Java, classes access control using modifiers to manage encapsulation and security through Public (visible everywhere), Private ( visible within the class) and Protected (visible within the package or subclasses). 
Encapsulation also control access in getter/setter.

An Object is the physical and actual blueprint being implemented.  In other words, it's the actual house being built from the blueprint.  
In Advanced Java, the object can perform actions defined by its class and contains values for its attributes.  
An object represents runtime entity stored in memory, acts as a container of fields (state) and methods (behaviors) along with identity. 
Object in Advance Java is a reference based entity and participants in advanced concepts like polymorphism and synchronization.

Object 1 (my_ranch): Footage = 1800sqft, Bedrooms = 3, Bathrooms = 2, Color = White
Object 2 (the_mansion): Bedrooms = 10, Footage = 1500sqft, 778 Brighten Road, Color = Stone
